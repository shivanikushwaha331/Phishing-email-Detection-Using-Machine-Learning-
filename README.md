# Phishing-email-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning-
This project presents a standalone system designed to automatically detect phishing emails using various machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify incoming emails as either "Phishing" or "Legitimate" (Ham), significantly enhancing email security by flagging malicious content before it can cause harm. This system is built upon a carefully curated dataset, extensive data preprocessing, insightful feature engineering, and robust machine learning models.
Programming Language: Python
Core Libraries:
1. pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)
2. numpy (for numerical operations)
3. scikit-learn (for machine learning models, preprocessing, and evaluation)
4. nltk (for natural language processing tasks)
5. xgboost (for XGBoost model)
